## 🖥️ **Getting Started with OS**

This section introduces you to the basic commands used to interact with your computer's **Operating System**. These commands are essential for navigating the file system, managing files and directories, and automating tasks through the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.

### 🔹 **What You'll Learn:**

* **Basic OS Commands:** Learn how to navigate the file system using commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd` on **macOS**, and `dir`, `cd`, and `mkdir` on **Windows**.
* **File Operations:** Understand how to create, delete, and modify files and directories with commands like `touch`, `rm`, and `mv` (macOS) or `copy`, `del`, and `move` (Windows).
* **System Management:** Basic tasks like clearing the terminal and checking the current directory for smooth navigation.

## 🧰 Module 2: Foundation of Data Analysis

### Getting Started with Pandas

**Pandas** is a Python library for fast, flexible data analysis.
It provides two main structures: **Series** (1D) and **DataFrame** (2D).
You can easily read, clean, merge, and transform data from many sources.
Perfect for efficient data handling, analysis, and visualization.

Pandas lets you load, inspect, and explore datasets easily using functions like `read_csv()`, `head()`, `columns`, and `shape`. You can select specific columns with `data['column']` and access values directly using indexing. A full dataset is a **DataFrame**, while each column is a **Series**. These basics help you quickly understand and work with real-world data.
