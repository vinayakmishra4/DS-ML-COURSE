## 🧐 What is EDA?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of analyzing and visualizing datasets to:

* Summarize key characteristics
* Detect anomalies or missing values
* Understand relationships between variables
* Prepare data for modeling

Think of it as **getting to know your data before making decisions**.

## 📌 Key Concepts Covered

This notebook introduces **core EDA techniques** using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

* Load datasets in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)
* Preview data with `.head()`, `.tail()`
* Check data types, missing values, and dataset shape

### 2️⃣ Descriptive Statistics

* Summary statistics with `.describe()`
* Measures of central tendency: **mean, median, mode**
* Measures of spread: **variance, standard deviation**

### 3️⃣ Univariate Analysis

* Study individual variables
* Visualize distributions with **histograms**, **boxplots**, and **bar charts**
* Identify skewness, outliers, and anomalies

### 4️⃣ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

* Explore relationships between variables
* Use **scatter plots**, **pair plots**, and **heatmaps**
* Calculate correlation coefficients

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization

* Enhance understanding with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
* Compare variables, visualize trends, and detect patterns

## 💡 Why EDA is Important

Performing thorough EDA allows you to:

✅ Identify and handle missing values or outliers
✅ Understand distributions and relationships
✅ Discover patterns that guide decision-making
✅ Ensure clean, ready-to-use data for machine learning or analytics

> Good EDA often **saves hours** of troubleshooting later.
