# 📊 Data Analysis with Python

This notebook focuses on **foundational data analysis techniques** using Python. It demonstrates how to explore, summarize, and visualize data by working with both **numerical and categorical features**, helping build strong analytical thinking and practical EDA skills.

---

## 🧠 Objective of the Analysis

The main goal of this analysis is to:

* Understand the structure and nature of the dataset
* Perform statistical analysis on numerical columns
* Analyze categorical data using frequency and percentage distribution
* Use visualizations to clearly interpret data patterns

---

## 🔍 Analysis Breakdown

### 📌 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration

* The dataset is loaded using **Pandas**.
* Initial inspection is performed to understand:

  * Number of rows and columns
  * Column names and data types
  * Overall dataset structure
* Functions like `head()`, `info()`, and basic inspection methods are used.

---

### 📌 2. Numerical Data Analysis

* Numerical columns are analyzed using:

  * **Mean (Average)**
  * **Minimum and Maximum values**
  * Summary statistics via `describe()`
* This analysis helps in:

  * Understanding value ranges
  * Identifying data spread
  * Observing overall numerical trends

---

### 📌 3. Categorical Data Analysis

* Categorical features are analyzed using:

  * `value_counts()`
  * Frequency-based summaries
* This helps in identifying:

  * Most frequent categories
  * Distribution imbalance
  * Category dominance within the dataset

---

### 📌 4. Percentage Calculation

* Percentages are calculated for categorical variables to:

  * Show proportional contribution of each category
  * Improve interpretability of categorical data
* Percentage values are later used in visualizations.

---

### 📌 5. Data Visualization

* Visualizations are created to support analytical findings:

  * **Bar charts** for categorical comparisons
  * **Pie charts** with percentage labels for proportion analysis
* These plots make the analysis more intuitive and visually appealing.

---

### 📌 6. Observations & Interpretation

* Statistical results and visual outputs are interpreted to:

  * Compare numerical values
  * Understand categorical distributions
  * Draw meaningful insights from the dataset

---

## 📈 Key Learning Outcomes

By completing this analysis, you will learn how to:

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Analyze numerical and categorical data separately
* Calculate and interpret percentages
* Create meaningful visualizations
* Convert raw data into understandable insights

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python** – core programming language
* **Pandas** – data handling and analysis
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Matplotlib** – data visualization
