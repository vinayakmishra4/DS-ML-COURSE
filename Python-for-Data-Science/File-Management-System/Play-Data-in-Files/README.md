## 📁 File Access Modes

| Mode    | Description                                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'r'`   | Read-only mode. File must exist.                                           |
| `'w'`   | Write-only mode. Overwrites file if it exists or creates a new one.        |
| `'a'`   | Append-only mode. Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.                  |
| `'r+'`  | Read and write mode. File must exist.                                      |
| `'w+'`  | Write and read mode. Overwrites existing file or creates a new one.        |
| `'a+'`  | Append and read mode. Reads and appends at the end; creates if not exists. |
| `'rb'`  | Read-only in binary mode. File must exist.                                 |
| `'wb'`  | Write-only in binary mode. Creates or overwrites file.                     |
| `'ab'`  | Append-only in binary mode. Creates file if it doesn't exist.              |
| `'rb+'` | Read and write in binary mode. File must exist.                            |
| `'wb+'` | Write and read in binary mode. Creates or overwrites file.                 |
| `'ab+'` | Append and read in binary mode. Creates file if it doesn’t exist.          |

## 📖 Reading Data from Files

Python offers multiple methods to read text files—such as `.read()`, `.readline()`, and loop iteration—making it easy to handle both small and large datasets efficiently.

| Method          | Description                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read()`        | Reads the entire file content as a single string.       |
| `readline()`    | Reads the file one line at a time.                      |
| `readlines()`   | Returns a list containing each line as a string.        |
| `for line in f` | Iterates over each line in the file (memory-efficient). |

## 🧠 Text Processing in Python

Text processing is the foundational step in analyzing textual data. It typically involves reading text from a file, cleaning it, and extracting useful patterns or metrics like word frequencies.

### Basic Example

```python
# Step 1: Read text from a file
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read().lower()  # Normalize case

# Step 2: Split into words
words = text.split()

# Step 3: Count word frequencies
freq = {}
for word in words:
    freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1

# Step 4: Sort by frequency
sorted_freq = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Step 5: Print results
for word, count in sorted_freq:
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

## 💡 Key Takeaways

* Use the correct file mode (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, etc.) based on the task.
* Always prefer using `with open(...)` to ensure files are closed properly.
* Use `.read()`, `.readline()`, or iterate line-by-line depending on the file size.
* Normalize text (e.g., lowercase) for consistent processing.
* Use dictionaries to efficiently count word frequencies.

---

## 🚀 Real-World Use Cases

* 📊 Analyze server or application logs to detect anomalies.
* 📚 Summarize documents or articles based on word frequency.
* 🔍 Build simple search features for local text files.
* 🧠 Perform text preprocessing for machine learning models.
* 📝 Automate daily reporting from structured text files.
