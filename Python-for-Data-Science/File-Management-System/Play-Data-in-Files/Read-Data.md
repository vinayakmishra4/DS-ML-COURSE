## ðŸ§  Text Processing in Python

Text processing is a core component of data science and natural language processing (NLP). It involves reading, cleaning, analyzing, and extracting insights from textual data. Python provides a variety of tools and libraries to make text processing efficient and powerful.

### ðŸ“˜ What Is Text Processing?

Text processing includes tasks such as:
- Reading and parsing raw text files
- Converting text to lowercase (normalization)
- Removing punctuation and special characters
- Tokenizing text (splitting into words)
- Counting word frequencies
- Sorting and visualizing results

### ðŸ”¤ Simple Example: Word Frequency Counter

```python
import string

# Step 1: Read text from a file
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read().lower()  # Normalize case

# Step 2: Remove punctuation
text = text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation))

# Step 3: Split into words
words = text.split()

# Step 4: Count word frequencies
freq = {}
for word in words:
    freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1

# Step 5: Sort by frequency (descending)
sorted_freq = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Step 6: Display results
print("ðŸ“Š Word Frequencies:\n")
for word, count in sorted_freq:
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

### ðŸ“ˆ Whatâ€™s Next?

You can enhance your text processing by:
- Removing stopwords (e.g., "the", "is", "and")
- Stemming or lemmatization
- Using libraries like `nltk`, `spaCy`, or `re` (regular expressions)
