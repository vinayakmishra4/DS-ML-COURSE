## 📁 File Access Modes

| Mode     | Description                                                              |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `'r'`    | Read-only mode. File must exist.                                          |
| `'w'`    | Write-only mode. Overwrites file if it exists or creates a new one.       |
| `'a'`    | Append-only mode. Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.                 |
| `'r+'`   | Read and write mode. File must exist.                                     |
| `'w+'`   | Write and read mode. Overwrites existing file or creates a new one.       |
| `'a+'`   | Append and read mode. Reads and appends at the end; creates if not exists.|
| `'rb'`   | Read-only in binary mode. File must exist.                                |
| `'wb'`   | Write-only in binary mode. Creates or overwrites file.                    |
| `'ab'`   | Append-only in binary mode. Creates file if it doesn't exist.             |
| `'rb+'`  | Read and write in binary mode. File must exist.                           |
| `'wb+'`  | Write and read in binary mode. Creates or overwrites file.                |
| `'ab+'`  | Append and read in binary mode. Creates file if it doesn’t exist.         |
